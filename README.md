Qira's Folk: a social network app created in React

Summary: a social network app that allows users to connect and chat with other users.

Features: registration, log-in, and reset forgotten password functions ||
edit personal profile: add a photo and biography, change password, and delete account ||
make friends: search for other users and connect ||
chat room: using socket.io

Technical details: This was the app I learned React with, so it is a rolling dirtball of code using classes, hooks, redux, and the kitchen sink. I probably wouldn't do it like this again...

Uses a postgreSQL database, and AWS for password recovery emails and image storage.
